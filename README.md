# Oddities
Oddities is a multi-functional bot that greatly simplifies server moderation and needs. It is open sourced (found here) and I will try to update it as much as I can.

If wanting to invite the original one/hosted one then do so by clicking the link:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1065031090835828746&permissions=1496125090999&scope=bot%20applications.commands

## Side note(s)
No need for credits however it would always be appreciated if you do decide to give credits for this, also Oddities is far from being done so expect errors among other things.

Also I will refine this file later.
